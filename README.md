## Background
This is a project I worked on while attending Codefellows. The assignment was to build a survey app that displays images, three at a time, to users and asks them to select the image they prefer. After displaying sets of three 25 times, the images dissapear and are replaced by a table of data and a chart reflecting the user's selections.
